    <p><strong>Treatment on Referral </strong>â€“ Tick this box if you are treating a patient that has been referred to you. If the referral is for advanced mandatory services no patient charge will be deducted. If the patient is referred for
        Additional Services (Sedation or Domiciliary Services) a charge will be taken, as this is considered a new course of treatment. A charge band in part 5 must also be present.</p>
    <p><strong>Free repair/replacement </strong>â€“ Tick this box if a restoration has to be repaired or replaced within 12 months of being provided. This applies to all patients whether exempt / remitted from charges or charge payers. If
        other treatment is also provided on the same course of treatment and a patient charge is applicable, this should be entered in patient charge collected box in part 4, otherwise no patient charge will be deducted. A charge
        band in part 5 must also be present and should be the band applicable to the whole course of treatment.</p>
    <p><strong>Further treatment within 2 months </strong>â€“ Tick this box if this course of treatment was required within 2 months of the completion of a previous course of treatment and is in the same or lower band. This applies to all
        patients whether exempt / remitted from charges or charge payers. In this circumstance no patient charge will be deducted.<br><br>This does not apply if the original course of treatment was either â€˜urgentâ€™ treatment or was incomplete
        treatment. Additionally if an â€˜urgentâ€™ treatment is required at any point within 2 months this cannot be claimed as continuation and must be claimed as a separate course of treatment. In these circumstances a patient charge will be deducted.</p>
    <p><strong>Domiciliary Services </strong>â€“ Tick this box if domiciliary services have been provided. If treatment has been provided then a charge band in part 5 should be Ticked and a patient charge will be deducted.</p>
    <p><strong>Sedation Services </strong>â€“ Tick this box if sedation services have been provided. If treatment has been provided then a charge band in part 5 should be ticked and a patient charge will be deducted.</p>
